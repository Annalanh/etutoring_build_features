First time, Client sends a request to Server. The server has not found any Session ID from this request and responses a normal webpage and includes SET-COOKIE: SessionID=xyz

From now, every request from client will include Session ID = xyz (by Cookies).

If you clear Cookies, certainly the Session ID is gone.
